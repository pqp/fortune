# fortune

A simple "fortune-of-the-day" email subscription service that I'm working on. It's mostly intended to demonstrate my competence in web development, backend work, automation and (eventually) CI pipelines.

# Running

If you'd like to host the site yourself, a simple `docker-compose` call in `srv/` should suffice:

`$ docker-compose up`

Though it *currently* won't launch because of MySQL driver mishaps. More to come with that!
